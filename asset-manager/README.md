# Asset Manager

This document serves as a comprehensive workshop guide that will walk you through the process of migrating a Java application to Azure using GitHub Copilot app modernization. The workshop covers assessment, Java/framework upgrades, migration to Azure services, containerization, and deployment.

**What the modernization Process Will Do:**
The modernization will transform your application from the outdated technologies to a modern Azure-native solution. This includes upgrading from Java 8 to Java 21, migrating from Spring Boot 2.x to 3.x, standardizing storage on Azure Blob Storage, adopting Azure Service Bus for messaging, migrating to Azure Database for PostgreSQL, implementing managed identity authentication, adding health checks, containerizing the applications, and preparing them for cloud deployment with proper monitoring.

### Assess Your Java Application

The first step is to assess the sample Java application `asset-manager`. The assessment provides insights into the application's readiness for migration to Azure.

1. Open VS Code with all the prerequisites installed for the asset manager by changing the directory to the `asset-manager` directory and running `code .` in that directory.
1. In the Activity sidebar, open the **GitHub Copilot app modernization** extension pane.
1. In the **QUICKSTART** section, click **Start Assessment** to trigger the app assessment.

   ![Trigger Assessment](doc-media/trigger-assessment.png)

1. Wait for the assessment to be completed. This step could take several minutes.
1. Upon completion, an **Assessment Report** tab opens. This report provides a categorized view of cloud readiness issues and recommended solutions. Select the **Issues** tab to view proposed solutions and proceed with migration steps.

### Upgrade Runtime & Frameworks

1. In the **Java Upgrade** table at the bottom of the **Issues** tab, click the **Run Task** button of the first entry **Java Version Upgrade**.

    ![Java Upgrade](doc-media/java-upgrade.png)
1. After clicking the **Run Task** button, the Copilot Chat panel will open with Agent Mode. The agent will check out a new branch and start upgrading the JDK version and Spring/Spring Boot framework. Click **Allow** for any requests from the agent.

> Note: The upgrading tool also supports upgrading to JDK 25 (the latest LTS version). To do this, click on the generated chat message, edit the target Java version to 25, and then click **Send** to apply the change.

### Migrate to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server using Predefined Tasks

Then you can migrate the sample Java application `asset-manager` to Azure.

> Note: We've set up a [workshop/java-upgrade](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/workshop/java-upgrade/asset-manager) branch where the Java upgrade has already been completed. Feel free to switch to this branch if you'd like to skip ahead and continue with the rest of the workshop.

1. For this workshop, select **Migrate to Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Spring)** in the Solution list, then click **Run Task**.

   ![Confirm Solution](doc-media/confirm-postgresql-solution.png)
1. After clicking the **Run Task** button in the Assessment Report, the Copilot Chat panel will open with Agent Mode.
1. The Copilot Agent will analyze the project, generate and open **plan.md** and **progress.md**, then automatically proceed with the migration process.
1. The agent checks the version control system status and checks out a new branch for migration, then performs the code changes. Click **Allow** for any tool call requests from the agent.
1. When the code migration is complete, the agent will automatically run a **validation and fix iteration loop** which includes:
   - **CVE Validation**: Detects Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures in current dependencies and fixes them.
   - **Build Validation**: Attempts to resolve any build errors.
   - **Consistency Validation**: Analyzes the code for functional consistency.
   - **Test Validation**: Runs unit tests and automatically fixes any failures.
   - **Completeness Validation**: Catches migration items missed in the initial code migration and fixes them.
1. After all validations complete, the agent generates a **summary.md** as the final step.
1. Review the proposed code changes and click **Keep** to apply them.

### Migrate to Azure Blob Storage using Predefined Tasks

1. Click the **Run Task** in the Assessment Report for the storage migration row that migrates storage to Azure Blob Storage.
1. The following steps are the same as the above PostgreSQL server migration.

### Migrate to Azure Service Bus using Predefined Tasks

1. Click the **Run Task** in the Assessment Report, on the right of the row `Messaging Service Migration to Azure Service Bus`.
1. The following steps are the same as the above PostgreSQL server migration.

### Expose health endpoints using Custom Skills

In this section, you will use custom skills to expose health endpoints for your applications instead of writing code yourself. The following steps demonstrate how to create a custom skill with references and proper prompts.

> Note: Custom skills (My Skills) are not supported for the IntelliJ IDEA plugin. If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you can skip this section.

1. In the Activity sidebar, open the **GitHub Copilot app modernization** extension pane. Hover over the **TASKS** section, and then select **Create a Custom Skill**.

   ![Create Custom Skill](doc-media/create-formula-from-source-control.png)
1. A **Create a Skill** form opens with the following fields. Fill them in as shown below:
   - **Skill Name**: `expose-health-endpoint`
   - **Skill Description**: `This skill helps add Spring Boot Actuator health endpoints for Azure Container Apps deployment readiness.`
   - **Skill Content**: `You are a Spring Boot developer assistant, follow the Spring Boot Actuator documentation to add basic health endpoints for Azure Container Apps deployment.`

1. Click **Add Resources** to add the Spring Boot Actuator official documentation as a resource. Paste the following link: `https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/actuator/endpoints.html`.

   ![Create a Skill form](doc-media/health-endpoint-task.png)
1. Click **Save** to create the skill. Your custom skill now appears in the **TASKS** > **My Skills** section.
1. Click **Run** to execute it.
1. The Copilot chat window opens in Agent Mode and automatically generates the migration plan, checks out a new branch, performs code changes, and runs the validation and fix iteration loop. Click **Allow** for any tool call requests from the agent.
1. Review the proposed code changes and click **Keep** to apply them.

### Containerize Applications

Now that you have successfully migrated your Java application to use Azure services, the next step is to prepare it for cloud deployment by containerizing both the web and worker modules. In this section, you will use **Containerization Tasks** to containerize your migrated applications.
> Note: If you encounter any issues with the previous migration step, you can directly proceed with the containerization step using the [workshop/expected](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/workshop/expected/asset-manager) branch.

1. In the Activity sidebar, open the **GitHub Copilot app modernization** extension pane. In the **TASKS** section, expand **Common Tasks** > **Containerize Tasks** and click the run button for **Containerize Application**.
  
    ![Run Containerize Application task](doc-media/containerization-run-task.png)

1. A predefined prompt will be populated in the Copilot Chat panel with Agent Mode. Copilot Agent will start to analyze the workspace and to create a **containerization-plan.copiotmd** with the containerization plan.

    ![Containerization prompt and plan](doc-media/containerization-plan.png)
1. View the plan and collaborate with Copilot Agent as it follows the **Execution Steps** in the plan by clicking **Continue**/**Allow** in pop-up chat notifications to run commands. Some of the execution steps leverage agentic tools of **Container Assist**.

    <!-- ![Containerization execution steps](doc-media/containerization-execution-steps.png) -->
1. Copilot Agent will help generate Dockerfile, build Docker images and fix build errors if there are any. Click **Keep** to apply the generated code.

### Deploy to Azure

At this point, you have successfully migrated the sample Java application `asset-manager` to Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Spring), Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Service Bus, and exposed health endpoints via Spring Boot Actuator. Now, you can start the deployment to Azure.
> Note: If you encounter any issues with the previous migration step, you can directly proceed with the deployment step using the [workshop/expected](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/workshop/expected/asset-manager) branch.

1. In the Activity sidebar, open the **GitHub Copilot app modernization** extension pane. In the **TASKS** section, expand **Common Tasks** > **Deployment Tasks**. Click the run button for **Provision Infrastructure and Deploy to Azure**.

    ![Run Deployment task](doc-media/deployment-run-task.png)
1. A predefined prompt will be populated in the Copilot Chat panel with Agent Mode. The default hosting Azure service is Azure Container Apps.To change the hosting service to **Azure Kubernetes Service** (AKS), click on the prompt in the Copilot Chat panel and edit the last sentence of the prompt to **Hosting service: AKS**.

    ![Deployment prompt](doc-media/deployment-prompt.png)
1. Click ****Continue**/**Allow** if pop-up notifications to let Copilot Agent analyze the project and create a deployment plan in **plan.copilotmd** with Azure resources architecture, recommended Azure resources for project and security configurations, and execution steps for deployment.

1. View the architecture diagram, resource configurations, and execution steps in the plan. Click **Keep** to save the plan and type in **Execute the plan** to start the deployment.

    ![Deployment execute](doc-media/deployment-execute.png)
1. When prompted, click **Continue**/**Allow** in chat notifications or type **y**/**yes** in terminal as Copilot Agent follows the plan and leverages agent tools to create and run provisioning and deployment scripts, fix potential errors, and finish the deployment. You can also check the deployment status in **progress.copilotmd**. **DO NOT interrupt** when provisioning or deployment scripts are running.

    ![Deployment progress](doc-media/deployment-progress.png)

> Note: If you encounter any issues with the deployment step, you can refer to the expected Copilot-generated deployment scripts in `/.azure` folder of the [workshop/deployment-expected](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/tree/workshop/deployment-expected/asset-manager) branch to compare your deployment scripts and troubleshoot the problems.

#### Clean up

When no longer needed, you can delete all related resources using the following scripts.

Windows:
```batch
scripts\cleanup-azure-resources.cmd -ResourceGroupName <your resource group name>
```

Linux:
```bash
scripts/cleanup-azure-resources.sh -ResourceGroupName <your resource group name>
```

If you deploy the app using GitHub Codespaces, delete the Codespaces environment by navigating to your forked repository in GitHub and selecting **Code** > **Codespaces** > **Delete**.
